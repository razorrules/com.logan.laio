Laio
Laio (Logans All In One) Unity package

#Summary: Laio is intended to include many custom Extension methods, features, tools, etc that I wish unity included by default. Laio is something that I personally use and simply work on in my free time.

#DISCLAMER Not ALL code in this, is personally written by me. I have taken inspiration from many different sources and will attempt to add them into comments above parts that drew inspriation from them, if not their code. I make sure that all code is as effecient as possible and sometimes the most effecient method is already writen. I have also included some additional packages made by other people that I often find myself using.
